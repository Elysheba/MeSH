	"description": "Our main purpose is to provide a hierarchically-organized terminology for indexing and cataloging of biomedical information such as MEDLINE/PUBmed and other NLM databases. We also distribute pharmaceutical information through our RxNorm database, and manage the curation of the UMLS and SnoMed database. Information on the descriptor data elements can be found: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/dtype.html. Tree hierarchies can be found here: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/2019/download/2019New_Mesh_Tree_Hierarchy.txt. This includes only the MeSH qualifiers related to disease identifiers. In the original table, multiple classifiers exist: A - Anatomy, B - Organisms, C - Diseases, D - Chemicals and Drugs, E - Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques and Equipment, F - Psychiatry and Psychology, G - Phenomena and Processes, H - Disciplines and Occupations, I - Anthropology, Education, Sociology and Social Phenomena, J - Technology and Food and Beverages, K - Humanities, L - Information Science, M - Persons, N - Health Care, V - Publication Type, Z - Geographical Locations",,
